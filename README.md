## Hello there👋🏻

#### A Back-End Developer by day☀️ and a Spring Community Contributor by Night🌙

Throughout my journey, I discovered a curiosity for technological solutions, which led me to begin my studies. I developed a strong interest in Software Development, particularly in the Back-end area with Java. Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge through technical courses and a future postgraduate degree. 🚀  

I am currently working on personal projects using Java and Spring Boot, such as creating REST API's, operating with relational databases, utilizing version control tools like Git, and applying agile methodologies like Scrum. Through these technologies, I actively contribute to communities to provide support and learn from others. 🗣️  


* ⚙️ I use most often: `.java`, `.spring_boot`, `.mysql`
* 🌎 I'm mostly active within the **Spring Community**.
